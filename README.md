# Programming-Problems

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems. The solutions are implemented in both Java and JavaScript. The Java solutions are located in the `Java/src/` directory, while the JavaScript solutions are divided into problem implementations in `js/Problems/` and corresponding Jest test cases in `js/Tests/`.

## Current Solutions

Here is a list of the problems I've solved along with links to the corresponding LeetCode problem:

| Problem | Solution |
| ------- | -------- |
| [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) | [JavaScript](js/Problems/twoSum.js) |
| [Palindrome Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/) | [JavaScript](js/Problems/isPalindrome.js) |
| [Contains Duplicate](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/) | [JavaScript](js/Problems/containsDuplicate.js) |
| [Valid Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/) | [JavaScript](js/Problems/isAnagram.js) |
| [Top K Frequent Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/) | [Java](Java/src/TopKFrequent.java)|
| [Valid Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/) | [JavaScript](js/Problems/isPalindrome.js) |
| [Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/) | [JavaScript](js/Problems/twoSum2.js) |

## Java Solutions

The `Java/src/` directory contains my Java implementations for LeetCode problems. Each problem is implemented in its own Java file.

## JavaScript Solutions

The JavaScript solutions are divided into two parts:

1. **Problem Implementations**: The JavaScript problem implementations are located in the `js/Problems/` directory. Each problem is implemented in its own JavaScript file.

2. **Jest Test Cases**: The corresponding Jest test cases for the JavaScript problems are located in the `js/Tests/` directory. Each problem has its own test file that ensures the correctness of the implementation.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PalmaAnd/Programming-Problems.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Change into the repository directory:

    ```bash
    cd Programming-Problems
    ```

3. **Select a Solution**: Navigate to the directory of the specific problem you're interested in. For Java solutions, navigate to `Java/src/`. For JavaScript solutions, navigate to `js/Problems/`.

## Running Tests

1. **Install Dependencies**: Before running the tests, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Then, navigate to the project's root directory and install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. **Run Tests**: To run the Jest tests for the JavaScript solutions, navigate to the `js/Tests/` directory and execute the following command:

    ```bash
    npm test
    ```

    This command will run all the test cases and display the results.
