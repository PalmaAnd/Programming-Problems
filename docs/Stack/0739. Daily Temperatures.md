## Intuition

When approaching this problem, my initial thoughts were to efficiently find the number of days I need to wait for a warmer temperature for each day in the given array of daily temperatures.

## Brute Force Approach

1. Initialize an array called `answer` to store the result, where `answer[i]` will represent the number of days one has to wait after the `i`-th day to get a warmer temperature.

2. Initialize a variable `counter` to keep track of the number of days waited. This counter will be reset to zero for each day.

3. Iterate through the `temperatures` array from left to right using a loop with the variable `i` as the current day's index.

4. Inside the outer loop:
   - Reset the `counter` to zero for the current day because we want to start counting the days waited from zero.

   - Start an inner loop with variable `j` to compare the temperature of the current day (`temperatures[i]`) with the temperatures of the subsequent days.

   - For each day in the inner loop, increment the `counter` to keep track of the number of days waited.

   - If a day is found where the temperature is higher than the current day's temperature (`temperatures[j] > temperatures[i]`), set `answer[i]` to the value of `counter`. This means we've found a warmer day, so we store the number of days waited and break out of the inner loop.

5. Continue this process for each day in the outer loop, calculating the number of days waited for warmer temperatures.

6. After the loops complete, the `answer` array contains the number of days one has to wait for a warmer temperature for each day.

### Complexity

- Time complexity: The time complexity of this solution is $O(n^2)$, where `n` is the length of the `temperatures` array. This is because we use a nested loop to compare each day's temperature with the temperatures of the subsequent days.

- Space complexity: The space complexity is $O(n)$ because we create an `answer` array of the same length as the input array to store the result.

### Code

```java
public int[] dailyTemperaturesSlow(int[] temperatures) {
    int[] answer = new int[temperatures.length];
    int counter = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < temperatures.length; i++) {
        counter = 0;
        for (int j = i + 1; j < temperatures.length; j++) {
            counter++;
            if (temperatures[j] > temperatures[i]){
                answer[i] = counter;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    return answer;
}
```

## Stack Approach

The approach I used to solve this problem involves the use of a stack to keep track of the indices of temperatures for which I haven't found a warmer day yet. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. Initialize an array called `answer` to store the result, where `answer[i]` will represent the number of days I have to wait after the `i`-th day to get a warmer temperature.

2. Create a stack called `stack` to store the indices of temperatures.

3. Iterate through the `temperatures` array from left to right using a loop with the variable `i` as the current day's index.

4. Inside the loop:
   - While the `stack` is not empty and the current temperature (`temperatures[i]`) is greater than the temperature at the index stored at the top of the stack, I have found a warmer day.
   - For each such temperature, I calculate the number of days waited by subtracting the current day's index (`i`) from the index at the top of the stack. I then store this value in the `answer` array at the corresponding index.
   - I pop the index from the `stack` because I have found a warmer day for that temperature.

5. I push the current day's index (`i`) onto the `stack` to continue searching for a warmer day for it.

6. After the loop completes, the `answer` array contains the number of days I have to wait for a warmer temperature for each day.

### Complexity

- Time complexity: The time complexity of this solution is $O(n)$, where `n` is the length of the `temperatures` array. This is because we iterate through the array once, and each element is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.

- Space complexity: The space complexity is $O(n)$ as well. In the worst case, when temperatures are in non-decreasing order, all indices may be pushed onto the stack, resulting in $O(n)$ space usage.

### Code

```java
public int[] dailyTemperatures(int[] temperatures) {
    int[] answer = new int[temperatures.length];
    Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < temperatures.length; i++) {
        // While the stack is not empty and the current temperature is greater than the temperature at the index
        // stored at the top of the stack, we have found a warmer day.
        while (!stack.isEmpty() && temperatures[i] > temperatures[stack.peek()]) {
            // Get the index of the temperature for which we found a warmer day.
            int prevIndex = stack.pop();

            // Calculate the number of days waited and store it in the answer array.
            answer[prevIndex] = i - prevIndex;
        }
        stack.push(i);
    }

    return answer;
```
