# Intuition
My initial thoughts on solving this problem were to create a stack data structure that not only supports the standard push and pop operations but also efficiently keeps track of the minimum value in the stack.

# Approach
The approach I took to solving this problem involved implementing a custom stack data structure that maintains extra information for each element, specifically the minimum value up to that element. This allows me to efficiently track the minimum value in the stack as I push and pop elements.

- When I push a new element onto the stack, I calculate its minimum value based on the current minimum and the new element's value. I then update the current minimum and push the element onto the stack.
- When I pop an element from the stack, I remove the top element and update the current minimum if necessary.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
    - Push operation: `O(1)` - I perform a constant number of operations to push an element onto the stack.
    - Pop operation: `O(1)` - Popping an element from the stack is a constant time operation.
    - Top operation: `O(1)` - Accessing the top element of the stack takes constant time.
    - GetMin operation: `O(1)` - Retrieving the minimum value from the stack is a constant time operation.
    - Overall, the time complexity for all operations is `O(1)`.

- Space complexity:
    - The space complexity for the stack itself is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the stack.
    - Additional space is used for variables and references, but they are all constant, so the overall space complexity is still `O(n)`.

This approach efficiently maintains the minimum value in the stack while supporting standard stack operations.

# Code
```
class MinStack {
    private int min;

    private Node topEntry;

    static class Node {
        int val;
        int minValue;
        Node parent;
        Node next;
        Node (int val, Node parent, int minValue){
            this.val = val;
            this.minValue = Math.min(val, minValue);
            if (parent != null) {
                this.parent = parent;
                this.parent.next = this;
            }
        }
    }

    public MinStack() {
        this.min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        this.topEntry = null;
    }

    public void push(int val) {
        Node newEntry;
        if (topEntry == null){
            newEntry = new Node(val, null, val);
        } else {
            newEntry = new Node(val, this.topEntry, min);
        }
        this.topEntry = newEntry;
        this.min = newEntry.minValue;
    }

    public void pop() {
        int removedMin = this.topEntry.minValue;
        this.topEntry = this.topEntry.parent;
        if (this.topEntry == null){
            min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        } else if (removedMin == min) {
            min = this.topEntry.minValue;
        }

    }

    public int top() {
        return topEntry.val;
    }

    public int getMin() {
        return min;
    }
}

```
