# 3Sum Problem

## Intuition
The 3Sum problem involves finding all unique triplets in an array of integers that sum up to zero. The problem can be challenging due to the need to handle duplicates and efficiently find valid triplets.

## First Approach: Ugly and brute force
My initial approach to solving this problem was straightforward:
- I used three nested loops to iterate through the `nums` array to consider all possible triplets.
- For each triplet, I checked if the sum of the three elements equals the target value of zero.
- If it did, I added the triplet to the result list while ensuring uniqueness.
- While this approach logically solved the problem, it suffered from high time complexity $(O(n^3))$, making it impractical for large input arrays.

## Second Attempt: Using a Set and two pointer
To optimize the solution and improve efficiency, I adopted a different approach:
- I sorted the `nums` array in ascending order to simplify the search for triplets using `Arrays.sort(nums)`.
- I used the two-pointer technique to efficiently find triplets whose sum equals zero.
- While iterating through the `nums` array:
    - I fixed one element (e.g., `nums[i]`) and used two pointers (`left = j` and `right = k`) to find the other two elements.
    - I handled duplicates by skipping identical elements when searching for triplets.
    - I maintained a `Set` to store unique triplets.
- After finding all valid triplets, I converted the `Set` to a list to return the final result.

## Complexity
- Time complexity for the second approach: $O(n^2)$
    - The sorting step takes $O(n*log(n))$ time.
    - The two-pointer search step takes $O(n^2)$ time.
- Space complexity for the second approach: $O(n)$
    - The `Set` is used to store unique triplets.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> threeSum(int[] nums) {
        int target = 0; // The integer we want to get by adding 3 entries
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        Set<List<Integer>> helperSet = new HashSet<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++){
            int j = i + 1;
            int k = nums.length - 1;
            while(j < k){
                int sum = nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k];
                if (sum == target){
                    helperSet.add(Arrays.asList(nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]));
                    j++;
                    k--;
                } else if (sum < target) {
                    j++;
                } else {
                    k--;
                }
            }
        }
        return new ArrayList<>(helperSet);
    }
}
