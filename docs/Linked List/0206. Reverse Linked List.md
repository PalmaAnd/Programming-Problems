# Reverse Linked List

## Intuition
When reversing a singly-linked list, we need to change the direction of the pointers to make the last node the new head and ensure that each node points to its previous node.

## Approach

1. Initialize a variable `answer` as `null`. This will be used to keep track of the reversed list.
2. Start iterating through the original linked list from the head node.
3. In each iteration:
   - Store the next node of the current node in a temporary variable `nextTemp`.
   - Reverse the current node's `next` pointer to point to the `answer` node, effectively reversing the direction.
   - Move the `answer` pointer to the current node, making it the new head of the reversed list.
   - Move the `head` pointer to `nextTemp` to continue the iteration.
4. After the loop, the `answer` pointer will point to the new head of the reversed list.
5. Return `answer`, which is the reversed linked list.

## Complexity

- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. We iterate through all the nodes once.
- Space complexity: O(1), as we use only a constant amount of additional space to store temporary variables.
  
### Code

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
        ListNode answer = null;
        while (head != null) {
            ListNode nextTemp = head.next; // Store the next node
            head.next = answer; // Reverse the current node's next pointer
            answer = head; // Move the 'answer' pointer one step forward
            head = nextTemp; // Move the 'head' pointer one step forward
        }
        return answer; // 'answer' now points to the new head of the reversed list
    }
}
```
