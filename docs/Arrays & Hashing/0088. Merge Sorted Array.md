# Intuition
My first thought was processing the `nums1`array from the back to the front. This approach involves using three pointers:
- one pointer to access the last not processed entry of the **original** `num1`
- another pointer to do the same thing for `nums2`
- and a last one to point at the index of `nums1` that will be modified

We compare elements from both arrays and fill in the larger element at the end of the nums1 array. This approach idoesn't require additional space by using the given space in nums1.

# Approach
The idea is to merge the two arrays into nums1 by iterating backward and filling in the largest elements. We use three pointers:
- `nums1Index` points to the last element in the original nums1 array.
- `nums2Index` points to the last element in the nums2 array.
- `mergedArrIndex` points to the last position in the merged array nums1.

We compare the elements at `nums1[nums1Index]` and `nums2[nums2Index]`, filling in the larger element at `nums1[mergedArrIndex]`. We continue this process, moving pointers accordingly, until all elements are merged.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $O(m + n)$ where m is the length of nums1 and n is the length of nums2.
- Space complexity: $O(1)$ as we are using constant extra space.

    public void merge(int[] nums1, int m, int[] nums2, int n) {
        int nums1Index = m - 1;
        int nums2Index = n - 1;
        int mergedArrIndex = nums1.length - 1;

        /*
         * The idea is to fill nums1 from the back to the front by comparing

        while (nums1Index >= 0 && nums2Index >= 0) {
            if (nums1[nums1Index] > nums2[nums2Index]) {
                nums1[mergedArrIndex] = nums1[nums1Index];
                nums1Index--;
            } else {
                nums1[mergedArrIndex] = nums2[nums2Index];
                nums2Index--;
            }
            mergedArrIndex--;
        }

        // If there are still elements in nums2 place them at the remaining spots of nums1
        while (nums2Index >= 0) {
            nums1[mergedArrIndex] = nums2[nums2Index];
            nums2Index--;
            mergedArrIndex--;
        }
    }
